# Using Machine Learning to Predict Super-Utilizers of Healthcare Services

## Abstract

In this dissertation, I aim to forecast high utilizers of emergency care and inpatient Medicare services (i.e., healthcare visits). Through a literature review, I demonstrate that accurate and reliable prediction of these future high utilizers will not only reduce healthcare costs but will also improve the overall quality of healthcare for patients. By identifying this population at risk before manifestation, I propose that there is still time to reverse undesirable healthcare trajectories (i.e., individuals whose clinical risk increases an excessive healthcare and treatment burden) through timely attention and proper care coordination. My dissertation culminates in the delivery of state-of-the-art predictive models that exploit well-researched clinical, behavioral, and social determinants associated with increased inpatient and emergency care utilization. I discuss my contributions to applied machine learning in healthcare herein, and further examine ethical concerns common to similar machine learning tasks. Finally, I conclude by reviewing how this research can be advanced through future work.
